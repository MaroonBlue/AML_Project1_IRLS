# AML Project1 - Iterative Reweighted Least Squares

This is the repository for project aiming at implementing IRLS and testing this solution. The solution includes the following parts:
* `Implementation` - script with implementation of class LogisticRegression_with_IRLS, which includes all neccessary methods (part 1 of the project).
* `SimulationData.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook which includes the simulation experiments (part 2 of the project).
* `Utils.py` - script including all functions neccessary to run tests from part 2.
* `RealDataExperiments.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook which includes real datasets experiments (part 3 of the project).
